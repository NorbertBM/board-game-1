## _What is Oneiros?_

Oneiros is a horror survival board game that emphasises discovery, exploration and of
course survival. It’s a very story-driven game that never feels the same when you play it
and that’s because at its core it has a mechanic we like to call “explore” (more later).

## THE STORY

Guy loses loved one (wife, kid or even both). He is so messed up he wants to talk to them
or bring them back and he is willing to do anything for it. So he goes to a witch / shaman
and arranges to perform a seance. For the seance they need four people in total, so they
get two more people involved.

They do the seance, but something goes horribly wrong and now they are stuck in what
we call The Nightmare Realm.

## THE NIGHTMARE REALM

![the nightmare realm](/img/story/nightmare-realm.jpeg)

This will of course be represented by our board and is one of the main features /
attractions of the game.

The Nightmare Realm is represented by a number of tiles each divided into squares. The
player will have to navigate each square and pass from tile to tile while trying to escape
this real.

Why is our board such a big deal? — because just like any good nightmare, the board will
not let you escape.

In an attempt to combine difficulty with new-ness every time, we’ve come up with a way
to do that in having our board shift and change every fixed number of turns.

What does that mean? — that means that every other number of turns the entire board
will move (a la Forbidden Desert) and will form a new landscape every time. As such
things will never be where you found or left them and the player will have to use his wits
(and a bit of luck) to eﬀectively navigate and escape the realm.

And if that wasn’t enough, there is one more feature about the Nightmare Realm that
players will have to deal with…
…the fact that this realm can manifest their fears. These fears are basically the bad NPCs
that will hunt (and haunt) the player for the duration of the game. They are very hard to kill
and each have unique abilities depending on what kind of fear they are.

So let’s look at that for a second.
IDEA — the map also moves vertically, not just left, right, up and down. This allows for
certain places to be very hard to be reached.

## THE FEARS

There are 10 fears to choose from (fear of fire, fear of the dark, etc.) and each players
either choose one or gets one random at the start of the game.

![primal fears](/img/story/primal-fears.jpeg)

### Here are some examples:

- Fear of fire — manifests fire demon (can’t go near it, if so, you take 1 damage)
- Fear of dark — manifests shadow demon (can pass through objects)
- Fear of snakes —
- Fear of spiders —
- Fear or noise — acusticuphobia — demon can push and pull you
- Fear of dogs —
- Fear of blood — demon regens, cannot be killed (only a certain specific way)
- Fear of closed spaces —
- Fear of choking —
- Fear of storms —
- Fear of being alone —
- Fear of time —
- Fear of daylight —
- Fear of going blind — demon can’t see you, but it goes by sound
- Fear of speed — fast demon

Etc.

Fears are important because they aﬀect sanity and they are basically the bad guys of the
game.

_IDEA — you can conquer your fear by destroying the same demon three times? And if
you do what happens once you have no fear to manifest anymore?_

THE MANIFESTATION
So how do you bring about a demon into this world? Well it’s simple: one of the actions
the player can perform is explore. When you explore you draw a card and depending on
what the card says, well, that thing happens.
So for example if you decide to explore and you draw a card that says “manifest fear”,
you know what fear your character has chosen and you manifest it.
What does that mean? — that means you take the demon figurine assigned to the fear
and place it in the nearest adjacent square to you.
You have just manifested your fear. Good luck :)
Why is this not something you want? — because as stated, fears are incredibly hard to
beat and most of the time you will be running or hiding from them.
Hiding from them? How the hell do you hide in a board game?
I’m glad you asked. Let’s look at the actions a player can perform.
THE ACTIONS
On any given turn the player will be able to do 2 things:

1. Move
2. Perform an action
   All of the actions a player can perform, including moving, are managed by stamina. So
   let’s look at each of those individually:
3. Explore — this is one of the base mechanic of the game and enables the player to
   explore what is on the square they are currently on. When the player decides to
   explore he draws from a pile of cards and follows the instructions on it. The card
   decides what he has found or not. For instance, it can say “manifest fear”, in which
   case you do that. But it could also say “you found nothing”, “you have found item”
   and even “you have come across a location”. That location can be an old mine, a
   house, a cabin, a well, or anything we want. How does the location appear on the
   board? Simple: you take the piece (which our dear friend Chelu has pre-sculpted) and
   you place it on the nearest free and available square next to the character. And voila,
   you have come across a house.
4. Attack — pretty self explanatory :)
5. Drop / pick up — see above :)
6. Open / close — ok this is complicated, but basically you can open or close doors :D
7. Hide — this is another new and appealing mechanic and this is how it goes. Hide
   uses ALL the stamina and makes the player “invisible” for the mobs. You do however
   have to be at least two squares away from the mob you’re trying to hide from (and not
   move of course). As stated, fears are really hard to defeat, so a lot of the times you
   will be running or hiding from them. However while the player is indeed hidden, the
   mob will move to your last known location and you will have to roll a dice to see if the
   mob sees you or not. If the mob does…good luck :D
8. Distract — another new action, not sure how it works yet, but going with the idea that
   mobs are hard to beat, you will be able to use items or sound to distract mobs to
   diﬀerent squares so that you can go around them. Again you have to be a certain
   distance away from them, so you can’t distract a mob that is on the same square as
   you.
   Now let’s go back to character for a second :)
   THE CHARACTERS
   Each of our four main characters share the same stats. They are:
   HP — manages life and you die when it reaches 0.
   Stamina — manages movement and actions and can only be replenished per turn (or in
   some special cases).
   Sanity — manages the mind of the character and when it reaches max level you go
   insane and die / lose the game. Sanity can NEVER be reduced, it only goes up.
   While it is true that our characters all share the same stats, they do however vary slightly.
   Some will have a bit more stamina, or HP or sanity resistance, or even carry more items.
   This is a slight variations but one that does make a diﬀerence.
   You have four characters in total and each has their own backstory and everything.
   Main dude
   Shaman
   Character 3
   Character 4
   THE ITEMS
   This is NOT Diablo hack and slash or Dark Souls boss fights!
   The items you find in the game are unique, very hard to come by and they oﬀer what
   might appear to be slight advantages, but in truth they matter a lot.
   And also, the items can be used for multiple purses, which makes the game more
   replayable. For instance if you use this key here, it’s gone, but you could’ve used it
   somewhere else. Next time!
   Player choice in item usage is very important and makes a huge diﬀerence.
   How do you win / lose?
   You lose by getting to 0 HP or going insane.
   You win by…???
   IDEA — there have to be at least 10 ways to beat the game which makes playing it over
   and over again new and exciting.
   Game impact — everything you do in the game matters and has a huge impact or
   repercussions.
   Theme(s)???
   NPCs
   While exploring the Nightmare Realm you will come across various NPCs you can interact
   with. They will give you quests or missions to go on and if you complete them you get
   stuﬀ.
   These NPCs are others like you, “lost dreamers”, some who got here by accident, some
   that want to stay, some that are stuck, etc.
   Unique abilities
   These are unique abilities you acquire only once and they are hard to come by. A lot of
   times you won’t even get them as they are so hard to acquire. Some ideas include:
   Phasing — going through object — perhaps after killing the shadow demon?
   Mirror walk — ability to travel between mirrors (which are waypoints basically)
   Block tiles — ability to block certain tiles when they move?
   Possible issue — is the game just an endless loop of move, explore, move, explore?
